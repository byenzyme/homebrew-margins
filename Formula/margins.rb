      Next step — finish setup (one time):
        margins setup   # downloads local models and installs the agent skills
                        # (/margins, /watermark) into Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor

      Then:
        margins new     # record a meeting
        margins note    # turn the latest meeting into a note in your agent

      To capture computer audio, grant your terminal "Screen & System Audio
      Recording" in System Settings > Privacy & Security, then restart it.
